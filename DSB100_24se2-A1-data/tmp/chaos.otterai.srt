00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,120
Unknown: Gerard nos Trinity, the
chaos, dearest creature in

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,840

00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,560
in my verse sounds like corpse,
core horse and worse,

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,640
it will keep you. Susie, busy,
make your head with heat, grow

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,040

of bad say, said, pay, paid

11
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:44,920
late, but pled, now I surely
will not plague you with such

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,240
words as vague and aid you, but
be careful how you speak. Say,

break steak but bleak and streak
previous precious fuchsia via

14
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:58,420

27
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,820
Blood and flood are not like
food, nor is mold like should

28
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,800
and would. Banquet is not nearly
parquet, which is said to rhyme

39
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,880

47
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,680
anger, neither does devour with
clangor soul, but fowl and

gain receiver, never guess it is
not safe. We say cars, valves,

66
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:53,080

ASP, grasp, wasp and cork and
work pronunciation, think of

73
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,680

spiky. Won't it make you lose

74
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,600
your wits writing growths and
saying grits, it's a dark abyss

75
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,980
or tunnel strewn with stones
like roller gunnel Islington, an

76
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,240
Isle of Wight has if verdict and
indict. Don't you think so?

77
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,060
